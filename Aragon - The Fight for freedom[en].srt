1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,600
So you ask me if there's gonna be a revolution?

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,460
I think there's already a revolution happening

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,880
We're seeing it everywhere

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,460
Honestly, I feel like blockchain is almost slipping through the cracks

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,720
They don't even see that we're a threat yet

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,960
If you have a decentralized entity that people can opt-in to

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,180
That starts performing services

8
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,720
that the government used to provide

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,440
Then what do you need these guys for

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,820
Bitcoin is the first real experiment

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:41,840
in DAOs

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,740
It's the first DAO that ever existed

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,100
What's a DAO?

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,440
I mean, Decentralized Autonomous Organization is what it stands for

15
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,640
Basically a decentralized autonomous organization is an organization

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,620
in which you can interact with it without having to go through an intermediary

17
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,220
I think that it's very important

18
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,480
for us to have tools that are really censorship-resistant

19
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,220
We have evolved so much as a society

20
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,520
but yet our governance structures

21
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,440
are hundreds of years old

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,460
We had a long period of monarchies

23
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,420
And that was a very centralized form of governance

24
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,900
And we had a great evolution with democracies

25
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,840
spreading that power a bit more

26
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,460
Now

27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,320
I would argue that corporations are superseding nation-states

28
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,840
in terms of their power

29
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,920
You're a digital serf, right now, living on Facebook

30
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,680
You work the land

31
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,580
You work the feed

32
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,780
And they take all the benefit, they take all of the value

33
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,680
It's a free service, where you are the product

34
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,880
Systems tend to perpetuate themselves

35
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,580
In other words, capitalism tends to do what's best for the market

36
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,180
Maybe not what is best for all the individuals who comprise the market

37
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,380
Silicon Valley, they tend to fund projects

38
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,420
or companies, that are trying to solve very much first world problems

39
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,620
How do you get your food 5 minutes quicker

40
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,900
How do you get your Uber 2 minutes faster

41
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,400
Whereas with blockchain technology, we have the ability to fund

42
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,600
initiatives that will produce true social good

43
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,400
and provide value to the most undervalued parts of humanity

44
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,140
This is the most egalitarian way

45
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,440
to construct systems

46
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,260
The culture is moving faster than the nation-state can handle

47
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,140
We can have that same personal feeling

48
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,200
that I have with my neighbour, with the people in a chat room

49
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,480
Traditional government institutions

50
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,600
take tremendously long time to fail

51
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,780
and when they do fail, there's usually violence

52
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,420
so we try not to let them fail

53
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,940
But today, we are in the first time in history

54
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,420
that we can actually try out new governance models

55
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,560
without the need of people getting killed

56
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,960
because we can try those governance models from the comfort of our sofa

57
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,040
In the mathematical realm

58
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,420
you can not threaten an algorithm with a gun

59
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,600
Because it's unstoppable, it's open source code

60
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,780
The cat's out of the bag right away when someone has the idea

61
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,880
Anything closed source is like saying "I'm a scientist and I've proved something

62
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,100
but I'm not gonna show you how I've proved it"

63
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,060
It's just free, you download it from the Internet

64
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,080
it's open source, you wanna enhance it, you do

65
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,380
and if you don't like it, you can just fork it

66
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,700
And if we have means by which groups can connect to each other

67
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,980
to form larger governance structures, that govern the entire whole

68
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,660
Then we have something that kind of is resembling a fractal structure

69
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,960
If you think about kind of other examples of super-organisms

70
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,580
you have like beehives and ant colonies

71
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,580
or even just the human body itself

72
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,440
it's a bunch of cells and micro-organisms

73
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,620
that are all working together in a single

74
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,220
like human body is their environment

75
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,060
But now what we have is proliferating with crypto networks

76
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,980
is actually these supranational protocols in which human activity can be governed

77
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,840
on this international basis, without nation-states, without corporations

78
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,820
So what it allows, is for people to come together from wherever

79
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,900
And they can interact together, they can make decisions

80
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,540
they can share in the common enterprise, and then they can all benefit together

81
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,220
Governance ends up being a really key part of making that work

82
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,440
And if view blockchains from a evolutionary standpoint

83
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,180
This may be the most critical feature one could imagine

84
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,540
Any organization of any kind

85
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:14,340
From your Mom-and-pop shop, to your decentralized autonomous organization

86
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,020
can create an entity on Aragons Network

87
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,340
and use it for all kinds of things

88
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,800
like their cap table, like payroll, to show you where their finances are going

89
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,500
for voting, for upgrades

90
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,480
to the way in which that organization works

91
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,540
Aragon is a tool that I think will spawn many different early attempts

92
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,240
at decentralized governance structures, which if implemented well, will be powerful

93
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,440
It's actually two components

94
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,060
So the first one is

95
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,160
The Aragon platform

96
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,780
to build and govern organizations

97
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,700
societies and protocols

98
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,820
And the other part is the first digital jurisdiction that has ever existed

99
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,720
The Aragon Network

100
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,660
That doesn't happen very often in the real world

101
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,460
It's rare that you get to set up a new central bank or a new government

102
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,400
So I think we're gonna be in sort of this Cambrian explosion

103
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,920
of experimentation on both of those fronts

104
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,080
But with any huge transition that happens in human history

105
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,880
they are very insistent in making us believe that we need them

106
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,940
So the incumbents are trying to use their

107
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,500
marketing power

108
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,000
their communication power

109
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,040
their surveillance power

110
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,060
to convince people that they still need them

111
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,720
But the market and the people will eventually figure out

112
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,180
that they don't

113
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,880
And that will be the end of establishment
